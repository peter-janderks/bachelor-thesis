Code for bachelor thesis
The src folder contains the ProjectQ code
The Quirk folder contains the Quirk circuits used in the thesis.

To run the files in the src repository ProjectQ needs to be installed. 
I used a [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) for this project.If pip is installed all the required packages can be installed by typing
```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you wish to install ProjectQ manually click [here](http://projectq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) for instruction.
The ProjectQ source code can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ.git)

The n_5.py, n_4.py files can be run as a usually python file, by typing 
python n_5.py in the command line.
